// questions:

// how do I link ClozeCard.js and BasicCard.js to app.js?

// is what I have in ClozeCard.js and BasicCard.js satisfactory or do I need to add more? 

// clarification on the instructions vs. what I have in inquirer re: questions
// if i'm running the inquirer the way I am how do I write the questions? (related to the last question)

// what is left for me to do and is there anything I can eliminate from my code?-
